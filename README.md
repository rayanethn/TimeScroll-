TimeScroll is an interactive HTML and CSS website that traces the history of planet Earth, from its birth to an imaginary future. By scrolling down the page, the user travels through the ages: from primitive volcanoes to modern civilizations, including dinosaurs, the industrial age, and possible sustainable or technological futures.

This project aims to raise awareness of humanity's impact on the environment while celebrating the wonders of our world's natural and technological development.
